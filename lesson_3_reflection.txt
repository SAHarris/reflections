When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote in instances of sharing my work, collaborating with others. It is
 also helpful to have a synced backup in the case of a local failure or working from 
 multiple machines.
 
 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
 I want to ensure my files are properly staged/updated before push/pulling them to or 
 from a remote.
