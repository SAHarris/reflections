When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote in instances of sharing my work, collaborating with others. It is
 also helpful to have a synced backup in the case of a local failure or working from 
 multiple machines.
 
 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
 I want to ensure my files are properly staged/updated before push/pulling them to or 
 from a remote.
 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 Clones are copies of repositories and can be downloaded to work on locally or are included in a fork, created by GitHub.
 
 Similarly, forks are copies of repositories, but they are created by GitHub and are linked to the original repository.
 
 Branches are a seperate versions of a repository and exist locally and/or on GitHub.
 
 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 
 This gives you the last known changes made remotely and allows you to see how they fir wioth your own subsequent commits.
 
 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 
 Without GitHub, collaborations would be tedious. I would provide code to a collaborator for review and there would be longer lead time between updates. I would also likely onloy work on one piece of the code while collaborators worked on other pieces. Github makes it possible to share much smaller tasks as the updates are more frequent and conflicts are resolved in a straight-forward manner.
